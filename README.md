# evefleets
EveFleets application is a third party mapping tool I wrote for the game EVE Online to aid fleet commanders in managing their fleets. Eve Fleets loads the exported game data
and displays it graphically on the screen. It is a multi-player tool that uses APIs written in PHP and allows team members to move fleet markers 
around the map in real time, and uses a MySQL database in the backend. This application uses complex data structures that allow for quick retrieval of 
information when the mouse hovers over a star.
